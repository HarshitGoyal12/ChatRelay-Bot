# 📝 Purpose and Scope

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the **ChatRelay Bot** system, a high-performance Slack bot implementation written in Go. The system demonstrates robust architectural patterns including comprehensive observability, concurrency handling, and enterprise-grade reliability features.

ChatRelay Bot serves as a relay service that receives user queries via Slack mentions, forwards them to configurable chat backend services, and streams responses back to users in real-time. The system includes a complete mock backend for development and testing scenarios.

For detailed information about specific components, see **Core Components**. For configuration details, see **Configuration**. For development setup and the mock backend, see **Development**.
