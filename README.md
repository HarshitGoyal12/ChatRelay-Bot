ChatRelay: High-Performance Golang Slack Bot with OpenTelemetry
Project Overview
This project implements the "ChatRelay" Slack bot in Golang, designed to demonstrate robust system design, concurrency, testing, and comprehensive observability using OpenTelemetry. The bot listens for mentions in Slack, forwards queries to a chat backend, and then "streams" the backend's response back to the user.

A mock chat backend is also provided to simulate the API interaction.

Features
Slack Integration: Connects to Slack via Socket Mode for real-time event handling.

Chat Backend Communication: Interacts with a designated chat backend API.

Simulated Streaming: Provides a simulated streaming experience back to Slack by updating messages incrementally.

Concurrency: Utilizes Go goroutines and channels for efficient handling of multiple requests.

Error Handling: Includes basic error handling and retry mechanisms for API calls.

Observability (OpenTelemetry):

Distributed Tracing: Generates traces for the entire request lifecycle (Slack event -> Backend call -> Slack response).

Structured Logging: Integrates slog with OpenTelemetry for correlated, structured logs.

Configurable Exporters: Supports gRPC, HTTP/protobuf, or console exporters for telemetry data.

Setup and Running Instructions
Prerequisites
Go (version 1.20 or later recommended)

A Slack Workspace where you can create a Slack App.

(Optional, for full observability demonstration) A local OpenTelemetry Collector and a backend like Jaeger. You can use Docker for this.

1. Create a Slack App
Go to api.slack.com/apps and click "Create New App".

Choose "From an app manifest".

Select your workspace and then paste the following manifest:

_metadata:
  major_version: 1
  minor_version: 1
display_information:
  name: ChatRelay Bot
  description: A high-performance Golang Slack bot for relaying chat queries.
  background_color: "#1a4623"
features:
  bot_user:
    display_name: ChatRelay
    always_online: false
oauth_config:
  scopes:
    bot:
      - app_mentions:read
      - chat:write
      - channels:history
      - im:history
      - groups:history
settings:
  event_subscriptions:
    request_url: "" # Leave empty for Socket Mode
    bot_events:
      - app_mention
  socket_mode_enabled: true
  token_rotation_enabled: false

Review and confirm to create the app.

Install the App to Your Workspace: Navigate to "Basic Information" -> "Install your app to your workspace" and click "Install to Workspace".

Get Your Tokens:

App-Level Token: Go to "Basic Information" -> "App-Level Tokens" -> "Generate Token and Scopes". Give it a name (e.g., chatrelay-app-token) and select the connections:write scope. Copy the xapp- token.

Bot User OAuth Token: Go to "OAuth & Permissions". Copy the xoxb- token.

2. Configure Environment Variables
Create a file named .env in the root directory of the project (e.g., chatrelay-bot/.env). Copy the contents from .env.example into your .env file and replace the placeholder values with your actual Slack tokens and desired settings.

Example .env content:

SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-YOUR_SLACK_APP_TOKEN
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-YOUR_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN
CHAT_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8081
LISTEN_PORT=8080
MOCK_BACKEND_PORT=8081
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=localhost:4317
OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=chatrelay-bot
REQUEST_TIMEOUT=30s
SLACK_API_RETRY_COUNT=3
SLACK_API_RETRY_DELAY=1s
BACKEND_API_RETRY_COUNT=3
BACKEND_API_RETRY_DELAY=1s

3. Run the Mock Backend
Open a new terminal and navigate to the chatrelay-bot directory.
Run the mock backend:

go run ./cmd/mockbackend

You should see output indicating the mock backend is listening on http://localhost:8081.

4. Run the ChatRelay Bot
Open another terminal and navigate to the chatrelay-bot directory.
Run the ChatRelay bot:

go run ./cmd/chatrelay

You should see output indicating the bot is connecting to Slack Socket Mode.

5. Interact with the Bot in Slack
Invite the ChatRelay bot to a channel (e.g., #general) by typing /invite @ChatRelay.

Mention the bot in the channel: @ChatRelay Tell me about Golang concurrency.

The bot should respond by first sending "Thinking...", then progressively updating the message with the response from the mock backend, and finally presenting the full message.

Design Decisions
Slack Connection Method
This bot uses Slack Socket Mode for connecting to the Slack API.
Justification:

Easier Local Development: Socket Mode does not require a publicly accessible endpoint or tools like ngrok for local development, as it establishes an outbound WebSocket connection to Slack. This simplifies testing and development iterations.

Security: By initiating outbound connections, it reduces the attack surface compared to exposing public HTTP endpoints.

Firewall Friendliness: Works well behind corporate firewalls.

Simulated Streaming Implementation
The mock backend currently provides a complete JSON response. To simulate a "streaming" experience back to Slack, the bot:

Sends an initial "Thinking..." message.

Splits the complete response into sentences (or logical chunks).

Updates the initial Slack message progressively with these chunks, adding an ellipsis (...) between updates to indicate ongoing processing.

Adds a small delay between updates to make the "streaming" effect visible to the user.

Sends the final, complete message once all chunks are processed.

For a true SSE (Server-Sent Events) backend, the internal/chatbackend/client.go would be updated to read the stream of SSE events, and the internal/bot/bot.go would update the Slack message as each message_part SSE event is received.

Concurrency Patterns
Go's built-in concurrency primitives, goroutines and channels, are extensively used:

Incoming Slack Events: The slack.Client uses a socketmode.Client which inherently handles incoming events concurrently. The listenForEvents goroutine processes events from the socketmode's internal event channel. Each EventsAPIEvent is then processed in its own goroutine (implicitly via the handleEventsAPIEvent and subsequent HandleAppMention calls which start spans).

Non-blocking Backend Calls: The chatbackend.Client.SendChatRequest is designed to be blocking per request, but since HandleAppMention runs in its own goroutine for each incoming Slack event, multiple concurrent Slack events can trigger parallel calls to the chat backend without blocking the main event loop.

Response Streaming: The simulated streaming to Slack involves time.Sleep calls, which are non-blocking for the Go runtime, allowing other goroutines to execute.

Scalability, Performance, and Observability ("The Million User Challenge")
(This section needs significant expansion as per the assignment. Here are placeholders for the topics to cover)

Concurrent Request Handling
(Discuss how goroutines and channels allow the bot to handle many simultaneous Slack conversations without blocking.)

Resource Management
(Explain how Go's efficient concurrency and garbage collection help manage CPU, memory, and network connections. Discuss potential optimizations.)

Bottleneck Identification & Mitigation
(Identify potential bottlenecks like Slack API rate limits, backend latency, and how the design (e.g., retries, concurrent processing) or future enhancements would address them.)

Horizontal Scalability
(Describe how multiple instances of this stateless bot could be deployed, perhaps via Kubernetes, and how a load balancer would distribute requests. Emphasize the stateless nature of the bot's core logic for easy scaling.)

Stability
(Discuss design considerations to ensure the microservice remains stable under heavy load, e.g., timeouts, circuit breakers (though not explicitly implemented here), robust error handling.)

Slack Marketplace Publication Plan
(Outline the technical and procedural steps to prepare the bot for listing on the official Slack App Directory. Consider: Slack's review guidelines, security best practices (token management, data handling, input validation), robust OAuth 2.0 implementation (for "Add to Slack" button), app manifest configuration, privacy policy, user support, and creating a compelling app listing.)
